#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build one figure: <name>.tex -> <name>.pdf -> <name>.svg
#
# Only the two hand-drawn diagrams, pipeline.tex and retrieval.tex, are built here. The other
# figures in this directory are plots written straight to .svg by the scripts in analysis/;
# they have no .tex source and no PDF step.
#
# Usage (compute node, never the login node):
#   sbatch --partition=shared-cpu,public-cpu --cpus-per-task=4 --mem=16G --time=00:30:00 \
#          --output=/dev/null --wrap="bash docs/figures/build.sh pipeline"
#
# Captions are off by default, since the README carries that text in its own prose. CAPTION=1
# defines \withcaption, which both sources test, and builds the captioned figure for the paper:
#   CAPTION=1 bash docs/figures/build.sh pipeline
#
# Takes a figure basename (or a path to the .tex) and leaves the .pdf and .svg beside the
# source. LaTeX runs twice so that any \ref or node coordinate resolved through the .aux is
# stable. The SVG is produced by MuPDF with the text converted to outlines, so it carries no
# font dependency and renders the same everywhere.
#
# One-time setup, on the LOGIN NODE (compute nodes have no network). The SVG converter comes
# from MuPDF; the LaTeX side needs the standalone class, which a minimal TeX Live lacks, so it
# is installed into a private tree beside this script rather than into the system install:
#   uv venv --python 3.12 docs/figures/.venv
#   uv pip install --python docs/figures/.venv/bin/python pymupdf
#   TEXMFHOME=docs/figures/.texmf tlmgr init-usertree
#   TEXMFHOME=docs/figures/.texmf tlmgr --usermode --ignore-warning \
#       --repository https://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2020/tlnet-final \
#       install standalone preview adjustbox gincltex filemod
# On a machine with a full TeX Live the tlmgr steps are unnecessary.
